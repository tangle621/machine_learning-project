# Setting up a Virtual Enviroment

It‚Äôs a common practice to have your Python apps and their instances running in virtual environments. Virtual environments allow different package sets and configurations to run simultaneously, and avoid conflicts due to incompatible package versions. 

Create a Virtual Enviroment in python by executing following command.
```bash
$ python3 -m venv env
```
activate the virtual environment.
```bash
# On Unix or MacOS (bash shell): 
/path/to/venv/bin/activate

# On Unix or MacOS (csh shell):
/path/to/venv/bin/activate.csh

# On Unix or MacOS (fish shell):
/path/to/venv/bin/activate.fish

# On Windows (command prompt):
\path\to\venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# On Windows (PowerShell):
\path\to\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```


# Installation:
now install all the dependiencies
```bash
 $ pip install requirements.txt
```
Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It‚Äôs free and open source. 

## Agora IO Setup:
create an Agora account by signing on agora.io 

create an App, copy the App id and App certificate from there and Paste it in the following files:
